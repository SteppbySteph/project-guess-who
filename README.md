# Project Name
Name: Guess Who
Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point:
This week we did a project based on the popular game Guess Who. The user interacts with the computer by asking questions to guess who the Secret person is (which is determined by the computer at start). As questions are asked, the computer filters out what is asked about. The game ends when either we guess on a character or when there are only one character left to choose from. 

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I had problems making the 'if statements' to work for the filter function. I realized that the user's guess had to be stored in a variable already in (checkQuestion) in order for the computer to pass the information to the next function. So basically knowing how functions and variables work gave me the tools to go on with the coding.
